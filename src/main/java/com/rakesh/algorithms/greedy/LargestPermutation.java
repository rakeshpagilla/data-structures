 *         Created at 2:49:01 PM You are given an array of N integers which is a
 *         permutation of the first N natural numbers. You can swap any two
 *         elements of the array. You can make at most K swaps. What is the
 *         largest permutation, in numerical order, you can make?
 * 
 *         Input Format The first line of the input contains two integers, and ,
 *         the size of the input array and the maximum swaps you can make,
 *         respectively. The second line of the input contains a permutation of
 *         the first natural numbers.
 * 
 *         Output Format Print the lexicographically largest permutation you can
 *         make with at most swaps.
